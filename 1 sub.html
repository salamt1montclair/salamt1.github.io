            <td>The field of cybersecurity known as "cloud security" is concerned with protecting cloud computing systems and guaranteeing the confidentiality and integrity of data on online platforms, apps, and infrastructure. It entails cooperative efforts between cloud service providers and their clientele, which might include both individuals and large corporations. With the goal of safeguarding cloud computing environments, apps, and stored data, this all-encompassing discipline combines best practices, protocols, and technology. While cloud service providers largely deal with backend development to reduce security flaws, customers are essential in helping to ensure that services are configured securely and encouraging responsible usage. In order to improve overall security posture, customers should also make sure that end-user devices and networks are properly secured.</td>

            <td>As cloud computing becomes more and more commonplace among businesses globally, cloud security becomes increasingly crucial. The relevance of this technology is highlighted by the recent projection from Gartner, which states that the global market for public cloud services is predicted to grow by 23.1% in 2021. IT professionals continue to have worries about security, governance, and compliance challenges related to putting data and apps on the cloud, even with the benefits of cloud computing. Sensitive corporate data and intellectual property are feared to be vulnerable to sophisticated cyberattacks or unintentional disclosures. Protecting data and business information, such as customer orders, private design documents, and financial records, is a crucial component of cloud security. Preventing data breaches and theft is crucial to maintaining customer trust and preserving competitive advantage.</td>

            <td>The cybersecurity difficulties associated with AI are similar to those associated with previous software generations, when manufacturers frequently neglected to emphasize built-in security and left users in charge of protecting their own systems. Even if AI software is unique, fundamental security concepts are still applicable. CISA intends to support its critical infrastructure initiatives and improve cyber defense by utilizing AI-powered technologies. By adopting AI, CISA hopes to guarantee the moral and responsible application of technology, according to pertinent rules and regulations, such as those pertaining to civil rights, privacy, federal procurement, and individual liberties. The agency's dedication to staying ahead of emerging cyberthreats and preserving the integrity of vital infrastructure networks is demonstrated by its deliberate integration of AI. </td>

            <td>Artificial intelligence, or AI, is the scientific pursuit of imitating human intellect in robots with the goal of allowing them to behave and think like humans. Because of this, AI machines may now accomplish activities that were previously limited to humans, sometimes even surpassing their performance. In order to guide their decision-making processes, many AI systems examine large amounts of training data in an effort to find patterns that can help them solve problems or find the best answers. Though AI has a future feel to it, the term "artificial intelligence" was first used in 1950 as a result of British mathematician and logician Alan Turing's conjectures about the possibility of "thinking machines" that might reason in a similar way to humans.</td>
